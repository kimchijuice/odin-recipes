    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The origins of Arroz à la Cubana are a little hazy. We know that the Spanish dish literally translates to Cuban-style rice, but the version as we Filipinos know it is neither truly Spanish nor Cuban. Versions of it exist in other former Spanish colonies, typically including a sofrito (a Spanish tomato-based sauce with many regional variations), rice, fried egg, and plantains—not a single speck of meat.

    The Filipino Arroz à la Cubana is almost unrecognizable when compared side-by-side to these versions. The most obvious difference: Ours has meat! Then, instead of a sofrito, we sauté the ground beef or pork in tomato paste. Saba bananas take the place of fried plantains. To round it out as a complete ulam, we add potatoes, raisins, and sometimes even carrots and peas. Interestingly, it’s just a bit of tomato sauce and a few boiled eggs away from being a giniling stew.
        
    Hazy history and uncanny resemblance to other Filipino dishes aside, this dish is a staple in most Pinoy households. It’s a hearty, satisfying, and uncomplicated dish that’s perfect for days when you want dinner on the table in half an hour.</p>
